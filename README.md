# Vera Selection Resort Booking Data Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at analyzing booking data from Vera Selection Resort (VSR) to understand booking patterns and reduce room cancellations. The dataset provided includes booking details and whether the customers arrived or cancelled their bookings. The goal is to develop a predictive model to identify factors contributing to cancellations and suggest strategies for reducing them.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the file `VS_Booking.csv`. It includes information such as booking ID, customer details, booking dates, room type, and whether the booking was cancelled or fulfilled.

## Project Structure
- `VS_Booking.csv`: Dataset containing booking details and labels (arrival or cancellation).
- `VS_Booking_deploy.csv`: Dataset without labels for model deployment and evaluation.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized machine learning model for deployment.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and any patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare features for modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Develop machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict booking cancellations.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and select the best-performing one.
5. **Deployment**: Serialize the chosen model for deployment and apply it to the unseen dataset (`VS_Booking_deploy.csv`).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 0.89 on the test dataset. It can be deployed for predicting booking cancellations in real-time.

## Future Work
- Further optimize the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- Collect additional data to improve model robustness and generalization.
- Explore other features or external datasets that may impact booking cancellations.
- Implement real-time monitoring of cancellation rates and adjust strategies accordingly.
